  <p>This repository contains the source code for the MVP of a medical service application designed to assist patients in making informed decisions about their health. This project was developed as part of the "Information Systems Architect" program at SBER21.</p>

  <h2>Key Roles and Responsibilities:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Team Lead:</strong> I played a leading role in the project, organizing the team, assigning tasks with RACI matrix, managing timelines with Ghant's diagram, and ensuring efficient communication. </li>
    <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Identified and evaluated potential risks associated with the project, including technical challenges, data security, and user experience issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technical Implementation:</h2>

  <p>The MVP application utilizes the following technologies:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Python:</strong> A versatile programming language for backend development.</li>
    <li><strong>FastAPI:</strong> A modern and high-performance web framework for building APIs.</li>
    <li><strong>Async PostgreSQL:</strong> Asynchronous database interaction for efficient data handling.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project Scope and Functionality:</h2>

  <p>The MVP prototype includes the following functionalities:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> Secure user registration and login.</li>
    <li><strong>Health Information Management:</strong> Data storage for user health records, including medical history, appointments, and medications.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalized Recommendations:</strong> Based on user health data, the application provides recommendations for improving overall well-being.</li>
    <li><strong>Health Content Access:</strong> Access to reliable health information and resources.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Future Development:</h2>

  <p>The MVP prototype serves as a foundation for future development, including:</p>

  <ul>
